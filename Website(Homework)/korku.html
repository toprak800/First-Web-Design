                True-crime writer Ellison Oswalt moves himself and his family into a house where a horrific crime took place earlier, but his family doesn't know. 
                He begins researching the crime so that he can write a new book about it to help his flailing career.
                He uses some "snuff" film footage he finds in the house to help him in his research, but he soon finds more than he bargained for. 
                There is a figure in each of the films but who or what is it?
                As a result, his family start to suffer (as does he) and things take a turn for the worse. Will they survive?</p></td>

            However, their idyllic marriage will soon fall to pieces, when, on that very same night, a vicious home-invasion by the deranged members of a local cult infuse the inanimate porcelain doll with the blackest of evil.
