             The dentist, Stu Price, is getting married to Lauren in Thailand and his best friends Doug Billings, Phil Wenneck and Alan Garner travel for the wedding.
             After the dinner party, Doug, Phil and Alan invite Stu to drink a beer around a bonfire on the beach with Lauren's brother Teddy.
             Phil brings a pack of beers and marshmallows to the group. On the next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan have a hangover and they do not recall what they did last night; their room is upside down; Teddy is missing; there is a little monkey in the room. 
             Teddy's finger is in a glass of water; Alan's head is shaved; and Stu has a tattoo on his face. The trio tries to track down last night to find what happened and sooner they discover Mr. Chow on the floor under the carpet. 
             They learn that they are in Bangkok and Mr. Chow sniffs cocaine before telling what happened last night. However he dies and Phil, Stu and Alan follow a lead to begin to unravel their crazy night.</p></td>

            Defying the very notion of good taste,Scary Movie out-parodies the pop culture parodies with a no-holds barred assault on the mostpopular images and talked-about moments from recent films, television and commercials.
			The film boldly fires barbs at the classic scenes from "Scream","The Sixth Sense," "The Matrix," "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "The Blair Witch Project," then goes on to mock a whole myriad of
            teen movie clichés, no matter the genre.</p></td>
